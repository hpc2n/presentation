### Overview

<small style="width: 45%; position: relative; bottom: 80px;">

- What is a batch scheduler?
- The Slurm batch scheduler: commands
- The Slurm batch script; nodes, cores, GPUs
- Sample job scripts
    - I/O intensive
    - MPI and OpenMP
    - job arrays
    - simple task farming
- Increasing the memory per task 
- Job monitoring and efficiency

### Batch schedulers 

<small style="width: 80%; position: relative; bottom: 80px;">

A batch system provides a mechanism to submit programs (jobs) or groups of programs to be executed automatically.

While batch systems are usually associated with large compute clusters, they could also be run on a single computer. Here, however, we will focus on its use on clusters, like Tetralith, Dardel, Alvis, or Kebnekaise.

#### Batch schedulers - HPC clusters

- Many compute nodes (calculations)
- Login node (submission, compiling, ...)
- Global disk (shared for all cluster, visible for all nodes)
- Node-local disk (best performance, only visible inside node, during job)

#### Batch schedulers - job types

<small style="width: 80%; position: relative; bottom: 80px;">

Many types of jobs can be handled by a job scheduler and made to run efficiently on a cluster. These are some typical examples:  

- Tasks that can be split up into many serial jobs
- Many instances of the same task
- MPI jobs
- Shared memory
- GPU jobs
